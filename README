This tool is for parsing Bruker method files into several different (and
hopefully more useful) formats.  This was developed to process magnetic
resonance imaging data collected from a high field and small bore Bruker MRI;
however, it may be useful for processing data from other machines as well.
Imaging data produced by a Bruker MRI is accompanied by a "method" file, which
stores information about the session and the acquisition parameters.  The goal
of this script is to convert these method files into something that is easier
to query and read.

This includes JSON output and formatted output based on a used-specified
pattern. There are four components derived from each method file: the header,
the header attributes, the parameters, and the parameter attributes.  The
header and parameters are key value pairs, and the attributes are additional
data attached to some of the key value pairs. The header evidently encodes
information related to the session date and compute environment, while the
parameters encode how the details of the scanner protocol.  The attributes seem
rather free-form, but among the things they sore, you can find the spatial
resolution and diffusion gradient b-vectors and b-values.

You can find an example script "example.sh" demonstrating a typical use of the
tool. However, some of the steps are acquisition specific, so you'll no doubt
have to modify it to fit your needs.
